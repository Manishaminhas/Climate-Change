# Climate-Change
Are humans responsible for climate change?
I have investigated on three factors that impact change: CO2 Emissions, Greenhouse gases and Population Growth. The research has been carried out on data available between 1960 to 2020. 
Basis the research, I found that humans are indeed responsible for climate change. If the countries contributing highest to climate change and each of us was to implement environment friendly alternatives it will definitely be a step in the right action.
